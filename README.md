# thalia

A collection of documentation for Clojure functions, macros,
protocols, and vars.

This documentation is intended to describe the way things behave in
particular versions of Clojure, including examples, bugs, and issues
Clojure programmers should be cautious about.  It has no "official"
status as Clojure documentation, and cannot make any promises that
future Clojure versions will continue to behave in this way.

## Usage

It is expected that this collection of documentation will grow slowly
over time, as it is written.  Here are links to parts of it that are
reasonably complete.  Comments and corrections are welcome.

* [Comparators in Clojure][ComparatorsInClojure], including the "See
  also" links within it to functions for sorted maps and sets, and
  sorting.
* [Equality][Equality]
